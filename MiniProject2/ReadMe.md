## What is cryptoMagic?

cryptoMagic is a command line utility designed to encrypt and decrypt `.txt` files to and from `.crp` files. It employs the CRP encryption protocol, which follows these steps:

---

1. Converts ASCII characters to their numerical values.
2. Subtracts 16 from these values.
3. If the resulting value is below 32, it further subtracts 32 and adds 144.
4. The final values are then written into a `.crp` file in hexadecimal format.

## How to Use cryptoMagic

**cryptoMagic** is a command-line utility that allows you to encrypt and decrypt files using the CRP encryption protocol. Here are the steps to use it:

1. **Command-Line Switches:**
   * `-E` for Encrypt
   * `-D` for Decrypt
   * If neither switch is specified, encryption is assumed by default.
2. **Input File Argument:**
   * The utility requires the name of the ASCII input file to be encrypted or decrypted as an argument.

### Examples:

* **Encrypt a file:**

  ```powershell
  cryptoMagic -E myFile.txt
  ```

  This command will encrypt the contents of `myFile.txt` and produce an encrypted file called `myFile.crp`.
* **Encrypt a file without specifying the switch:**

  ```powershell
  cryptoMagic myFile.txt
  ```

  This command will also encrypt `myFile.txt` and produce `myFile.crp`.
* **Decrypt a file:**

  ```powershell
  cryptoMagic -D myFile.crp
  ```

  This command will decrypt the contents of `myFile.crp` and produce a decrypted file called `myFile.txt`

By following these instructions, you can easily use cryptoMagic to secure and access your files. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! üòäüîê‚ú®

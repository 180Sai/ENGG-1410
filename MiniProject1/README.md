# Simulation of Tic-Tac-Toe with Enhanced AI Player
A C program that simulates a tic-tac-toe game inside the computer terminal. Over the length of the program, the number of wins and losses are tracked for each side with X’s or O’s.

The player (i.e. user) enters the size of grid that the tic-tac-toe game will be played on. Then, the player chooses to play with either a) themselves or b) the computer “AI” that has the capability of playing a winning move and preventing the player from winning in their next move; the AI presents some difficulty to the player.
